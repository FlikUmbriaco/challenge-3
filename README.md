# challenge-3
repo for challenge 3


- As a bootcamp student, I wanted to use javascript to build a random password generater
- I built this project to gain a better understanding of how to define and call elements in javascript. Also to understand the importance of commenting in code and how to use for loops
- The webpage acts as a random password generater
- During this project, I learned about javascript, for loops, and call and response elements.
